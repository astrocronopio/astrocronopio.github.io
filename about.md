* Bachelor & Master in Physics at Instituto Balseiro, Argentina. I studied ultra high energy cosmic rays at the Pierre Auger Observatory, and some other weird particles in the Photonic & Optomechanics Laboratory, Bariloche Atomic Center.

* I worked for 6 months as Data Scientist in the DESY ATLAS Group in Hamburg, Germany, applying Machine Learning approaches to Particle Physics. I studied Deep Graphs NN VAEs modeling energy readings inside the ATLAS Experiment.

* I have working as a Machine Learning engineer at [Jampp](https://www.jampp.com) since July, 2022. I work mostly on MLOps. I helped them train with healthy data, stabilized their predictions using a tool I developed, as well as creating different monitoring tools for product and data science teams.
