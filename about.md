Hello, I'm Evelyn and this my personal website. You can contact me through email [me@evecoronel.com](mailto:me@evecoronel.com), please go to [contact page](contact.html) for more info. 

Mainly I code for fun, I have been checking out [CTFs and competitive programming](code.html), I'm posting some of the things I have learned  in the process. Also, I like writing and music, sometimes I post what I write and some playlist I have made [in this page](art.html). 


-------------------------------------------

## What tools I use 
> I like using Unix to code using differents tools (listed below) to write machine learning algorithms (moslty deep learning CV) and to do data analysis in large datasets. 

> **Machine Learning Frameworks:** Tensorflow, PyTorch & Scikit Learn. 

> **Programming Languages:** Python, C++, Linux Shell Scripting (bash & awk).

> **Packages/Frameworks I'm experienced with:** Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, LaTeX, Gnuplot.


## What I'm currently learning
> * Docker & Servers: Using PostgreSQL
> * About NLP: mostly about Transformers in Hugging Face and implemented networks.
> * AWS: I want to implement my networks in the cloud instead using Colab or my local machine.



##  Physicist & Human being.

<!-- 
Machine Learning is a devil, and I happen to be a physicist. I'm from Sapucai, Paraguay. I love coding and decoding other's people code. Data Science is interesting and my education prepared me to be a scientist. I have experience in classical machine learning, also reinforcement and unsupervised learning. I worked in ML for more than a year and a half so far: industry and scientific research. I'm looking forward to new experiences.

* Bachelor & Master in Physics at Instituto Balseiro, Argentina. I studied ultra high energy cosmic rays at the Pierre Auger Observatory, and some other weird particules in the Photonic & Optomechanics Laboratory, Bariloche Atomic Center.

* I worked for 6 months as Data Scientist in the DESY ATLAS Group in Hamburg, Germany, in collaboration with Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and Jülich Supercomputing Centre, applying Machine Learning approaches to Particle Physics. I studied Deep Graphs NN VAEs modeling energy readings inside the ATLAS Experiment.

* Also I was part of the tutorial classes of Introduction to Machine Learning for Physicists in Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin during the winter term 2021-2022. 

* I play many games, mostly RPG PC games.
