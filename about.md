##  Physicist & Human being.

Machine Learning is a devil, and I happen to be a physicist. I'm from Sapucai, Paraguay. I love coding and decoding other's people code. Data Science is interesting and my education prepared me to be a scientist. I have experience in classical machine learning, also reinforcement and unsupervised learning. I worked in ML for more than a year and a half so far: industry and scientific research. I'm looking forward to new experiences.

Bachelor & Master in Physics at Instituto Balseiro, Argentina. I studied ultra high energy cosmic rays at the Pierre Auger Observatory, and some other weird particules in the Photonic & Optomechanics Laboratory, Bariloche Atomic Center.

I worked for 6 months as Data Scientist in the DESY ATLAS Group in Hamburg, Germany, in collaboration with Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and Jülich Supercomputing Centre, applying Machine Learning approaches to Particle Physics. I designed and developed a DGNN VAE modeling energy readings inside the ATLAS Experiment.

Also I was part of the tutorial classes of Introduction to Machine Learning for Physicists in Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin during the winter term 2021-2022. 

I play many games, mostly RPG PC games. Active player on League of Legends.
