## Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects

* Satisficing and Optimizing Metric: We optimize the most important features first, then we set a threshold for the other metric to satisfy.

* Choose a dev set and a test set to reflect data you expect to get in the future and consider important to do well on. It means: similar distributions to the real world data.

* Size of the test set:  Train/dev for really small dataset (10e4-10e5)

*  Human Error is a better target to beat than reaching Bayes Error
