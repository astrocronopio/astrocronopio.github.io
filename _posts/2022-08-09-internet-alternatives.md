## Twitter Alternative Browser: nitter.net

[nitter.net](nitter.net) has been really nice as an alternative to browse ocassionally twitter. I have an account but I don't want to login every time I want to check some older posts, disabling twitter's javascript help but it's a bit cumbersome.


## 12ft.io: bypassing paywalls

I use [12ft.io](12ft.io) all the time to read news, it's a nice tool to read well known newspapers with a bloody paywall. As the 12ft page states:

> Show me a 10ft paywall, Iâ€™ll show you a 12ft ladder.

It uses a very clever trick to bypass it:

> The idea is pretty simple, news sites want Google to index their content so it shows up in search results. So they don't show a paywall to the Google crawler. We benefit from this because the Google crawler will cache a copy of the site every time it crawls it.

> All we do is show you that cached, unpaywalled version of the page.
