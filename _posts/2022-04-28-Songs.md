### * [ROAR - Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u9NjchBPvM)

  > You can't see the forest if the trees <br>
  > Never stop burning... <br>

  > Dreams never come true. No one else can help you. <br>

### * [ROAR - The Comfort of a Laugh Track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieJP12dMelQ)

  > Why is it so hard to speak <br>
  > To people I don't know<br>
  > Is it something that you learn <br>
  > When constantly alone? <br>
  > When did I become a man <br>
  > Trapped inside a ghost? <br>

The [slowed version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNIc8RunXs) is way better than the original
