title: (c++) 1658 - Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero
categories: [Leetcode, cpp]
---


You are given an integer array $nums$ and an integer $x$. In one operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array nums and subtract its value from x. Note that this modifies the array for future operations.

Return the minimum number of operations to reduce x to exactly 0 if it is possible, otherwise, return -1.

Constraints:

* $1 <= nums.length <= 105$
* $1 <= nums[i] <= 104$
* $1 <= x <= 109$


## Brute force solution:

#### Input: 
```
nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5
```

Is (5-1) or (5-3) closer to 0? 3 



```
nums = [1,1,4,2], x = 2
```
Is (2-1) or (2-2) closer to 0? 2


- We needed 2 operations


----------------

#### Input 
```
nums = [5,6,7,8,9], x = 4
```

Is $abs(5-4) < abs(9-4)$? 5 

```
nums = [6,7,8,9], x = -1
```

It's not possible to get -1 from the following numbers.
We return -1.


### Borderline samples

* x is bigger than the sum of all numbers: we can inmediantly return -1;
* x is smaller than the smallest value in the array: we can return -1.
* `nums = [5,6,7,1,8,9], x = 1`, we need to all the way to 1.



### Different approach

#### Input 
```
nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5
```

The sum of all the number is 11, when we select 2 and 3, we end up with a subarray `nums = [1,1,4]` which has a sum if 6 = 11 - 5. Instead of focusing with the 5, we could find the biggest subarray with that sum.


#### Input Modified
```
nums = [1,1,4,2,3], y = 6
```

* The full sum is 11, as we want the largest subarray, let's remove the bigger value in one of the ends because it can achieve the target numbers with the minimun numbers of operations, i.e. 3

* `[1,1,4,2]` now the sum is 8, now we remove 2.
* `[1,1,4]` now the sum is 6, now we have removed 2 numbers. This is the minimum number of operations we need.


#### Input modified
```
nums = [5,6,7,8,9], y = 31
```

* The sum of all the numbers is 35
- If we remove 9, the remaining sum is now 22 which is less than we want. 
- If we remove  5, the sum is 30 
- There is no way to obtain the target sum, because how the problem is structured.



## Code
```c++
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
	int sum = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(),0);
	int target = sum - x;
	
	if (target<1) return -1;

	int i=0, j=nums.size(), counter=1;

	while(i<j){
		if(sum<target) return -1;
		if(sum==target) return counter;

		if(nums[i]<nums[j]) sum-=nums[j--];
		else sum-=nums[i++];

		counter++;
	}
	return -1;
}
```

Let's try one the cases:

#### Input: 
```c++
nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5

int sum = 11;
int target = 6;
int i = 0, j= 4, counter=0;


(0<4) 
	if(1<3) sum = 11-3;
	counter=1
	j=3
	i=0
(0<3)
	if(1<2) sum = 8-2;
	counter=2
	j=2
	i=0

(0<2)
	sum==target, return counter
```


#### Input: 
```

```
