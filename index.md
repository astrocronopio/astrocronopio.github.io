-------------------------------------------

## What tools I use / What I like using
> I like using Unix to code using differents tools (listed below) to write machine learning algorithms (moslty deep learning CV) and to do data analysis in large datasets. 

> **Machine Learning Frameworks:** Tensorflow, PyTorch & Scikit Learn. 

> **Programming Languages:** Python, C++, Linux Shell Scripting (bash & awk).

> **Packages/Frameworks I'm experienced with:** Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, LaTeX, Gnuplot.


## What I'm currently learning
> * Docker & Servers: Using PostgreSQL
> * About NLP: mostly about Transformers in Hugging Face and implemented networks.
> * AWS: I want to implement my networks in the cloud instead using Colab or my local machine.

# Projects

> ## Finetuning BERT to classify toxic comments [v 0.1]
> [This is a Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VrCIa6kskG0IA2wCYG13t7peJU7V0PfW?usp=sharing) I made using a Coursera Project to get started with Transformers and some of their uses. I plan to build a API for this webpage in next versions.

> ## This webpage source code:
> [Here](https://github.com/astrocronopio/astrocronopio.github.io) is my version, and this is the original [repo](https://github.com/sharu725/dark-side) in Github.
